      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am working toward being able to graduate from college. An experience that led me here is realizing how little money you can make without a degree of any kind. I am working toward these goals by going to school. I am also passing classes and trying my hardest in school to work toward these goals. One value I consider necessary for success is honesty. More values that I consider necessary are resiliency and patience. A short term goal I hope to accomplish in the near future is being able to afford a car and pay off the loans. Another goal is to be able to make it into college and pay off all my student debt. Some character traits I want to be known for are creative, ambitious, and patient. Some achievements I want to be known for are, graduating college, being financially stable, and being able to retire without a worry.</p>
